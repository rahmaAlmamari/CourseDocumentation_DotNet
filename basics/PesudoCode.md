# _**Pesudo Code Task**_

**Write the following example using pesudo code:**
1. Finding the Sum of Two Numbers?
  
   1. set X as the first number
   2. set Y as the second number
   3. set sum = X + Y 
   4. print sum

2. Finding Factorial of a Number (Iterative)?

   1. set factorial as n 
   2. set result = 1 and y = 2
   3. check if n == 1 or n == 0 print result
   4. check if n < 0 print wrong input
   5. check if n > 1 if yes result = result * y , y+1
   6. repeat step 5 for (n-1)
   7. print result

3. Given a list of numbers, find the largest one?
   
   1. set lar_num = 0
   2. take the first number in the list as X[i] where X is the number and i is the number index
   3. check if X[i] > lar_num if yes set lar_num = X[i] 
   4. move to the next number in the list by i+1
   5. repeat step 3 and 4 until the list is finished

4. Given a string, count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) it contains?

   1. set V as list which contain vowels letters V={u, a, e, i, o} 
   2. set count = 0
   3. take the first letter in your string as X[i] where X is the number and i is the number index
   4. check if X[i] is in the V list .. if yes count + 1
   5. move to next letter in the string by i+1
   6. repeat step 4 and 5 until string letters is finished
   7. print count

5. Reverse the order of characters in a given string?

   1. set string as list X
   2. count the number of letters you have in your string and store it in count
   3. print X[count-1]
   4. repeat step 3 until count == 0
